# My Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer 

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?

Command line are commands used to perform functions instead of using mouse. This is an alternative to the GUI that we usually use. On command line a programmer can perform all basic four functions such as create, edit, read and delete. 


### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?

No I couldn't stick to the timebox as everything is new to me and it took me a while to understand what is happening and I also started looking at the additional given material. In order to stick to the timebox I would like to read the material provided for the task and later delve into the additional material. 




### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do

Following are the 5 basic commands that I've used:

1. Pwd- This command shows the current working directory. 
2. ls-  This command display complete list of the files in the current directory
3. mkdir- This command makes a new file
4. rmdir- This command removes the file from the working directory 
5. cd- This command is used to change directory



### Did you learn anything unexpected?

Yes, timebox the task.




# Version Control with Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### Whats the difference between git and GitHub?

Git is distributed version control software that keeps a track of the things (history) that you are working on the computer.It also allows many people to work on one project at the same time. 
Git Hub is a web service where you can sign up and have an account and do projects and have version controls on them. 


### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?



### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?

Yes



### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?

No, I was unable to stick to the timebox. GIT and GIT HUB are completely new concepts for me. I had to go through some other material in order to learn git.


# Install and Explore Git 

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is a GitHub work flow?

No, I was unable to stick to the timebox. GIT and GIT HUB are completely new concepts for me. I had to go through some other material in order to learn git.


### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?

I noticed that my knowledge about this new technology is limited and I have to read and research more. whenever I was confused I looked at YouTube videos or Google. Luckly, I have a family friend who is familiar with the termnology and the system and I could ask him the issues I was facing. 



### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?

I will focus on the given material and explore additional material later as recommended in the guidelines. Try to timebox everything.




# Track and Commit Primer!

<!-- Copy your reflection answer into this file -->

### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?  

Stage is like putting material in the box and commit is like finally sealing the box.


# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is Master?

Master is the main branch that has all the records of the commits made. By default it is called 'Master'.


### Why create a Branch?

A branch is created so that multiple people can work on the same project and if not sure what code to run next or experiment with new ideas, then insted of crowding master branch, the code can be committed on a parallel branch. In short, branches capture all the new changes. This branch can be merged with the master branch later. 


### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?

The concepts are very well explained



# GitHub Fork & Clone

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

### What are some examples of when you would fork?

1. If I want to save my/someones work 
2. When I have to make changes in the project 
3. When I don't want the orignal project to be affected by the new changes/experiments.

### Write your own step-by-step fork and clone instructions. Describe what you did.

1. Forked the repo on GitHub
2. Clone the repo to my local
3. In Git Bash go to the reflections directory 
4. Open sprint 1 folder in VS code 
5. Begin editing in sprint 1 reflections file 

### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?

No



# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?

Didn't feel frustrated. 


### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made; was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?

No, I din't imagine that the websites are created like this. The preconceptions were far from the reality. I initially thought that you just have to code, didn't realise that there are going to be so many stages and processes involved.



# Thinking like a programmer

### Describe the process for solving problems

To solve a problem one has to start using time and try timeboxing. Plan, divide problem into small steps. Improve and learn with practice. 

### Will you follow that process? How?

Yes, I will follow this process. I am going to question myself, understand, plan, divide the problem, try to understand it, if stuck I am going to reassess and research and finally reflect.


### What did you learn about flipped classroom?

Flipped classroom are the new way of teaching. This allows candidates to self learn at their own pace and time. However, it is essential that the candidate timebox things 



# Introduce yourself

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? 

I always feel good when I am introduced to new people. Initially I didn't feel that I am introducing myself to strangers as there were many who were doing the same and it is nice to know more about someone with whom we are going to work for next three months. Hopefully I am going to make new friends. 

### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious? 

No, I was not self conscious.
