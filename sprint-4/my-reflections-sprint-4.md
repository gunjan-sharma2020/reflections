# My Reflections - Sprint Four 

# Code Readability Primer

### What code readability habit will you begin implementing today?

1. Naming code correctly 
2. Make many small functions instead of one big one 
3. Writing clean code.
4. Indenting code to best practice.



### Does code readability seem important to you, or unnecessarily fussy? Justify your answer.

As a beginner, I believe that code redability is important so that mentors/instructors can help us as well as we are also able to read others code. If the code is not readable then it is difficult to see what is happening and where is the problem exactly and for a beginner code looks a pile of letters that makes no sense. 




# Code Readability Challenge

### As a developer, how important do you think indenting is?

Indenting makes program easier to read and understand and it also indicates subordination. In general, clean code is good running and easy to maintain.



### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?

tabs

### What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that? Is your _downloads_ folder a reflection of that?

My workspace is not messy it is mostly organised be it code or any other folders on my computer. Yes, my code is a reflection of that.
 I didn't know about indentation before sprint 4 but when I look at my code now I think I've followed the indentation (not completely). My code is readable as far as I know. 
 My download folder is well organised.



# Testing

```
function testSum(){
    var expected = 7
    var actual = sum(5, 2)

    if (actual != expected) {
        console.log("It's broken..")
    } else {
        console.log("It works!")
    }
}
```
Have a go at writing a function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`: 

function Sum(x, y); {
    return (x + y)
}



### Do you think you would prefer using Unit Testing or Test Driven Development? Why?

TDD as this gives the flexibility to the developer the way he/she writes their code. In TDD method the developer writes the tests how the new code should behave.  



### How could these techniques be used together to make code that is reliable?




### Was your initial response to the idea of testing, "That sounds useful" or "That sounds like a hassle"? Why?

My initial response was that it is a hassle as it takes more time. 




# Repl.it - Code in your browser

### What was your first impression of the Repl.it website?
Good 


### How did you find using it in practice? Confusing? Useful?

Useful. I write code and see the result easily.

### When you say the name of the website in your head, how are you pronouncing it? "REPLIT"? "REP-ILL-IT"? "REPELL-IT"?

"REPLIT"


# Problem Solving and Pseudocode 

### Pick two problem solving techniques you would like to put into practice. Which ones have you chosen?

Ask the peer and googling. Ask peer is the most relevant one for me now as my teammates can relate to what I am talking and gooling is the first choice by default for me. 

### How will you implement these techniques into your day to day coding flow? How will you make sure that you actually do them?

I have already used 'Ask your peers for help' multiple times. Whenever there is a problem related to code or something i first google it and then ask my team on slack.


# JavaScript Variables and Object Types

### How did you find working through the Variables and Objects kata?

It was fun unless I got stuck at later stage and I asked for help from my cohort memebers. 

### Did you look at the tests while coding the kata? Was it helpful?

Yes, I did look at the code and followed instructions step by step 



# Manipulating JavaScript Objects

### What was the highlight of this kata for you?

Tests and clearing those tests were the highlights of this kata.




### Did you find you preferred following the steps given to you or using the test outputs in your repl? Why?

For first few steps I was comfortable with the test output but later stage had to follow the steps given.



# FizzBuzz (Super Edition)

### What was the most challenging part of Super FizzBuzz for you?

This whole exercise was difficult for me. I tried my best but couldn't do it, worst part is I didn't understand the tests given. 

### How did you find using pseudocode during this kata?

Pseudocode was really helpful. I understood the problem because of that.



# JavaScript Gradebook

### What was a surprising moment for you in this Gradebook Kata?



### Did you go back and rewrite code as you got to new steps? Is there anything you would change about your final code?





# Built-in Methods

### On a scale of 1 - 5, 5 means 'These built in methods are hard!' and 1 means 'Built in methods are easy.  Piece of cake' - how are you feeling following this Built-In-Methods kata? 




### What resources did you use to help you? How useful did you find them?

# JavaScript Olympics

### Did you find this took a longer or shorter time than you expected? Why?



### If you were to complete the kata again, what would you do differently next time?
