# Final Reflections - Sprint Four 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

Getting there slowly but kata challenge was really challenging for me.



### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel smart?

When I was able to do first two kata challenges in less than the time required. 

### Which parts of this sprint made you un-smart?

JavaScript Kata challenges FizzBuzz and Gradebook.

### Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this sprint? How often? Did you stretch your body?

Yes I did but kata challenges were with me always and the feeling that I can't do them made me question my ability.



### If you went back and did the JavaScript Basics course again from last sprint, how challenging do you think you would find it now?

I tried doing it in this sprint as well in order to find solution to Kata challenges. A lot of stuff makes sense now. It is not as challenging as it was in sprint 3.


### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this sprint, what would it say? 

"Start Doing Kata Challenges"

### What is Javascript?

JavaScript is the programming language that does controls the dynamic elements of web pages. JavaScript gives the functionality to the website or apps.
