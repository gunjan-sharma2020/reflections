'# My Reflections - Sprint Three

# Mindfulness 

### Have you done mindfulness or attention training before? 

Yes


### Are you able to identify any bias you have for or against mindfulness?   

No 


### What did you notice as you were meditating? 

While meditating I realised that it is difficult to focus on the present state of mind and my mind constantly wanders in past and future. 

### How did you find the overall experience? 

The experience really relaxded my mind. Actually I performed this when I was exausted with the Java script learning. Java script was too much for me and I stopped JS in between. After some time I practiced meditation i.e. deep breathing (breath in and breathout ) and once I was relaxed I started JS again and somehow JS started making sense.


### What's your daily habit commitment? 
    
I do deep breathing excersise daily. It really helps me cope with the stress



# Listening and Looping 

### What was it like to be fully listened to? 

It was great!!! felt like I am being listened after a long time. 

### What was it like to fully listen?

It was nice, however, being a talkative person I realised that it is difficult for me to remain quite/ not to interrrupt. This realisation is definately going to help me improve my listeniing skills.  




# Learning JavaScript

### What did you notice about your learning style? What resources worked for you and why? 



### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?

I mostly kept everything within the Timebox, however, when I started 'functions', it was difficult for me to understand and inbetween I was just kind of lost. I was finding difficult to retain the information. Therefore, I started practicing it more and it took a lot of time and still I haven't mastered it. 

### If you did this entire exercise again, would you get stuck at the same points as you did the first time? Where did you get stuck?  

I think so. I will be stuck with the functions part again.



# The DOM Primer and DevTools Primer

### Were you interested or bored during this exercise? Which parts were interesting? Which parts were boring?

This exercise was interesting. The parts where I learned that we can create, remove or change HTML elements, events and attributes and CSS styles. I didn't find anything boring.

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?

5 tabs open. All tabs are study related (YouTube and GitHub).



# DevTools Tutorial

### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths and limitations when doing this crash course?

I notices that I am able to understand a lot in limited time. My strength is my will to learn new things. However my limitation is that I am unable to retain all of the information available. 

### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?

I was using dev tools on another website simultaneously. Whenever I had any blocks then I either practiced it or searched google for my answers. 

### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name or some inappropriate words into the DOM of a website? If not, do so now. It's hilarious and a great way to amuse your non-technical friends. They will think you are a hacker wizard.

Yes. I actually played with the Dev Academy website and it was fun!!!
