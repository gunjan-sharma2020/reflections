# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  

HTML is the design and CSS is the style. The relationship between the two is that HTML is like a house and CSS is like interior decoration (making house look and feel like a house).


### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them? 

Since the HTML and CSS files were in different folders I couldn't link them. Since I had to publish, so I gave my github CSS path but then it was difficult to test local changes. So I took Sprint 1 and sprint 2 out of the blog folder and put it in main website folder and then referenced to the local CSS path. 
later before pushing I linked everything with the github path for CSS and HTML.


### Any moments of surprise or joy? 

Yes, when I saw the Box Model on my website 

### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?
